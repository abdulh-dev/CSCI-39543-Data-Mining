- evaluate the machine learning model


Data mining, sometimes called knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), is a broad term that has been used to include everything from web scraping to statistics to visualizations to machine learning.



#### Focus of this Course
- This course will focus primarily on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applied machine learning.
- EDA is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods [Wikipedia]. We'll learn how to use visualizations as well as statistical tests in order to recognize trends and relations within datasets.
- Applied machine learning is the application of machine learning to a specific data-related problem [DataRobot.com]. In other words, we're going to focus on understanding ML algorithms and using them to create predictive models, rather than creating, implementing, or modifying the algorithms themselves.
- Additionally, being able to evaluate the performance of our models and improve on them will be heavily emphasized.

#### Datasets and Tabular Data 
- For our purposes, we'll usually want data in tabular form. This corresponds to a table in a relational database, but more generically we call it a dataset. When using the Python library Pandas, you may also see it referred to as a dataframe. 
- Let's load a dataset in Weka, then view the dataset in tabular form by using the “edit” button. We'll start with the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and then the Iris dataset. 
- Each row is a data point, aka as instance, object, observation, record, or case. 
- Each column is a feature, aka as attribute, variable, field, or characteristic. 
- Let's use the “edit” button in Weka to view the data in tabular form.
