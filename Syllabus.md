### Learning Outcomes: 
- Examine and discuss fundamental concepts of data mining, data science, and machine learning. 
- Apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preparation techniques to real-world datasets. 
- Build baseline models, evaluate with appropriate metrics, and use the knowledge gained to design increasingly accurate models. 
- Experiment with various data preparation, feature engineering, data integration, and ML modeling techniques, and evaluate their efficacy. 
- Integrate effective techniques and approaches into a cohesive group project 
- Identify practical, technical, and ethical issues, limitations, and biases in an ML model

### Grading:
Exams and/or quizzes: 30% (2 exams, each are 15%)
Homework: 20%
Final Project: 50%

### Final Project:
The final project will be a group project, typically with groups of size 4-5. Each group will find data from one or more sources, prepare and integrate the data as necessary, analyze and visualize the data to identify any important characteristics and/or issues, design an ML model that deals with said issues, evaluate the model's performance using the appropriate metrics, attempt to improve the model using various approaches, and present your results. Deliverables will include your code, presentation, and a written report. Python and Jupyter Notebooks will be used unless permission is given otherwise. During the time allocated to the final project, I will be assessing each group's progress and each student's contributions weekly. At the end of the semester I will interview each student individually about their contributions to the project and understanding of the project.

### Homework:
Homework will be due every or almost every lecture week, for a total of 6 or 7 assignments. Homework must be submitted on Gradescope before class on the day it's due. Each assignment will be worth 2-4 points on your final grade. The first few assignments will be graded based on completion and effort, but once we get to programming assignments, effort will no longer guarantee completion. We will go over each assignment in class. You will be allowed to make up 5 points worth of homework with late submissions. Homework should be treated as a diagnostic tool. If you complete a homework but get questions wrong, it's up to you to correct your understanding of the material before the exams and project.
